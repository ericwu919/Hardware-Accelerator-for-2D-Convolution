Our design is fully functional. We tested with all parameter values asked, that being INW=12, R=9, C=8, MAXK=5; INW=18, R=9, C=8, MAXK=5; INW=24, R=16, C=17, MAXK=9.
For the specific parameters, we achieved the following clock frequencies: 12 bits with 925.925926 MHz (1.08ns); 18 bits with 757.575758 MHz (1.32ns); 24 bits with 636.942675 MHz (1.57ns).
We also did not have any significant warnings and no errors.

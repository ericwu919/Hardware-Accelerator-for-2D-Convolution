Our optimized design was fully functional. The counters in the top level were set to read the proper addresses from the input memory module in parallel. The MAC addresses were 
also set to forward the corresponding data through each pipeline instantiation.

We synthesized our optimized design with the same parameter values as our unoptimized design: INW=12, R=9, C=8, MAXK=5; INW=18, R=9, C=8, MAXK=5; INW=24, R=16, C=17, MAXK=9. 
Our results showed that the designs had a faster throughput and a lower average delay time, but necessitated a higher power consumption and greater area.

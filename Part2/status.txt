Our design was fully functional. We tested the design using OUTW = 24 and DEPTH = 19 and verified all signals by simulating the program on QuestaSim. We also synthesized the program using Synopsys and found the minimum 
possible clock period that meets timing requirements to be 0.91 ns, which is a frequency of 1098.9011 MHz

Our design is fully functional. We tested with TVALID_PROB at extreme values, and they all ran without error. Our design
also works with the two specific parameters listed, that being: INW=24, R=9, C=8, MAXK=4 and INW=10, R=15, C=13, MAXK=7. We 
found the minimum possible clock period that meets timing requirements to be 0.44ns

Our design is fully functional. We tested with TVALID_PROB at extreme values, and they all ran without error. Our design
also works with the two specific parameters listed, that being: INW=24, R=9, C=8, MAXK=4 and INW=10, R=15, C=13, MAXK=7. We 
found the minimum possible clock period that meets timing requirements with parameters INW=24, R=9, C=8, MAXK=4 to be 0.44ns
to which the frequency 2272.73 MHz. 
The minimum possible clock period and frequency that meets timing requirements with parameters INW=10, R=15, C=13, MAXK=7 to be 
0.45ns which is a frequency of 2222.22 MHz.
